# Actuators

The Actuators board is part of the mechatronics on Kraken, CUAUV’s 2020-2021 submarine. The board controls 16 pneumatic solenoid valves, which are responsible for torpedos, droppers, and the manipulator arm on the sub.

This is my first project on the team! I get to put theoretical knowledge into practice and gain tons of experience along the way. Interesting topics I encounter range from adding decoupling capacitors, experimenting PWM signals, to reading data sheets, designing layout, soldering…


Aside from the technical challenges, this project is special because it took place during Covid. I had to collaborate with team members on the other side of the globe and work on the board without access to lab space. However, everyone is so supportive and gave me a sense of belonging even know we have never met in person. I will never forget those 4am design reviews and the zoom stickers.
